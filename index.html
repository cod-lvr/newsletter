                <p>Newsletters make for great marketing materials, especially in the real estate industry. You can use it to write a message to clients, show new listings, and share tips and stories regarding the business that people might enjoy. </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on the types of properties and clients you deal with, you can go with a number of designs for your newsletter. If you showcase a lot of modern homes, for instance, try a minimalist look to go with the image of the house. Dealing with more traditional properties would be suited for a newsletter that uses serif fonts and muted or neutral colors. If you work with commercial properties, especially corporate spaces, on the other hand, use dark colors and bold contrasts to emphasize the majestic buildings and offices you'll feature.Â </p>

            <h5>A report by James Carleston</h5>
            <p>Since you're dealing with properties, remember to leave plenty of room in your layout for pictures. You want clients to see a property and wish they'd learn more about it. You can emphasize an image by leaving enough space between the picture and the text or try using a border to frame and draw attention to it.</p>

            <p>For your newsletter, don't just rely on listings and pictures of properties to make it interesting. People want newsletters, so they can stay informed. Add articles that will help homeowners and property buyers make the most of their investment. You can also update them on the state of the market, so they have an idea of what to do next. </p>
